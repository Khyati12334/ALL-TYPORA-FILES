# GITHUB AND GITBASH

We used GitHub website to host our code online. GitHub used a tool called Git to keep track of all the changes in the code.

We used commands like "ls" (to list all the files in the directory), "cd" (change to a different directory), "mkdir" and etc.

We can create a new directory/folder in any location using 'mkdir' commands. 'mkdir' stands for make directory.

The three areas in Git:

○ A working directory: Files are first modified in the working directory. 

○ A staging area: Hosts all the files which are changed before they are committed. 

○ A repository (local and remote): Hosts all the different committed versions of the files.

To make a git add and git commit the files with a message use: 

● git add  

● git commit -m "" (-m stands for message)

To associate the working directory on our git bash shell to this remote repository use: 

git remote add  

 ● We used any name for the  and the url of the github repository you created.

To push files to a remote repository use: 

git push -u  (-u stands for username which is promoted by this command)
