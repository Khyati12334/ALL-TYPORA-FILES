# CREATING CLASS - BLUEPRINTS

CLASS - A blueprint for an object is called a Class.

A class contains defined properties(like width, height) and functions (like display()).  

A class is used to create one or more objects having the same properties and functions as defined in the class.

First we have to make JS folder. Like if the class is about box, we can name it BOX.js and it is important to add that file name in index.html.

CONSTRUCTOR -  The purpose of a CONSTRUCTOR is to create an object and set values if there are any object properties present.

We can put the x, y, width and height values in the constructor ( ) { }.

We can display this object using a display() function.

We can design different classes corresponding to the different game objects.

Store the new translation and rotation setting and then revert back to the old setting when the object is drawn. This is done using push() and pop(). 

● push() - captures the new setting

● pop() - reverts back to the old setting 

● translate() - to change the 0 of the axis to a given x and y position.
