# ARRAYS

ARRAY - Collection of multiple values under the same variable is known as ARRAY .

ARRAYS are represented as - 

[ ] - SINGLE ARRAY

[ ] [ ] - MULTIPLE ARRAY

CHAR - Alphabets

NUM - 1,2,3 numbers

INSERTION - PUSH();

DELETE - POP();

STRING - It is an collection of CHAR and NUM.

EXAMPLES = 

1. `var arr1 = ['p' , 'q' , 'r' , 's' , 't']`;

`console.log(arr1);`

We have one array here. It is named as arr1. It contains p q r s t. Now we are printing it on the console. It will show like p q r s t .



2. `arr1.push("abc");`

`console.log(arr1);`

Now we are pushing means inserting a b c in the array arr1. And we are printing it to the console. It will show like p q r s t and plus it will show the a b c too.



3. `arr1.pop();`

   `console.log(arr1);`

   Now we are using pop(); function means we are removing the a b c from the array arr1. And now if we see in the console it will show p q r s t. Cause pop(); function only deletes the last one.
