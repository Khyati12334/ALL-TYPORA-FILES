# OOPS - OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING	

1.In this programming style, we write code as if everything in the programming world were an object - just like in the real world. 

2.In the real world, everything around us is an object. Each object has some properties and functions.

 PROPERTIES are the qualities/characteristics of the object. 

FUNCTIONS are actions that the object can do. They define the behavior of an object. 

CLASS- Collection of the object. Instance of object.

EX- A bottle of water.

(bottle-class,water-object)

{ } - it represents block

( ) - it represents function

AI  - AI means Artificial Intelligence.

like robots,drones etc.

We treat everything as a object. Object center and related to that object.

COMMENTS- It is nothing but it is a line for user purpose. After we make a function a comment it won't work.

To construct object using a blue print " construct()" for designing properties of the object.

BLUEPRINT- planning.

Properties are the same but values differ from computer to user.

VARIABLES - It stores some values in it.
