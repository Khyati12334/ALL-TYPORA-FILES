# CONSTRAINED BODIES

We can create CONSTRAINED BODIES using MATTER.JS.

When one body is constrained or restricted in its movement by the position and movement of another body is called a constrained body. 

1. We created a constraint using Matter.Constraint.create(). 
2. We also needed to pass some options to this function. The options were properties like length, stiffness etc that described the type of constraint.
