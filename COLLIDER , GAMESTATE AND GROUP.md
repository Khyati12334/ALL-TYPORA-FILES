# COLLIDER , GAMESTATE AND GROUP

COLLIDER - A COLLIDER is an invisible circle or rectangle that can have any size or position relative to the sprite and which will be used to detect collisions and overlapping with other sprites.

`sprite.setCollider`() function is used to set the collider shape and size.

In this T-REX game there are 2 states -

1.PLAYSTATE

2.ENDSTATE

GROUP - Grouped similar game objects together in a group and assigned the same behavior to all of them. Means, if there are 10 CLOUDS in the game so we need to write separate code for each of them. Instead we can group them and write the code only once so that it gets applied to all the CLOUDS present in the group.

DEBUG - Debug here means the properties of T-REX.
