# T-REX GAME

In P5 editor

We have created sprites for T-rex in setup function.

we have loaded images and animations in preload function.

We have written our code in the draw function.

If we want to track our T-rex's position we can use the function console.log( trex.y); It will be shown in the black space below the writing space.
